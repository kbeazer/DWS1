		<h1>Chef Beazy's Chicken Stew</h1>
			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>
				<q>Sweet, soft chicken that just slides off the bone!!</q>	
			</p>
			<p>
				This recipe has been in my family for over 40 years, and has been passed down for 3 generations.  It is very easy to learn, but it can take years to be able to master it.  Have fun trying different variations of your own, the world definitely needs more good food.
