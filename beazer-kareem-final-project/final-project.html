		<p id="intro">The <strong>U.S. Virgin Islands</strong> is an unincorporated organized 
		territory of the United States of America between the Caribbean Sea and the North 
		Atlantic Ocean, east of Puerto Rico. It was formerly known as the <i>Danish West 
		Indies</i>. Together with the British Virgin Islands, to the northeast, the 
		territory forms the Virgin Islands archipelago. The islands natural resources are 
		sun, sand, sea, and surf.</p>

				<h3>Climate</h3>
				<p>Tropical, tempered by easterly trade winds, relatively low humidity, 
				little seasonal temperature variation; rainy season May to November. Has 
				experienced several hurricanes in recent years as well as frequent and 
				severe droughts and floods.</p>		
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>Terrain</h3>
				<p>Mostly hilly to rugged and mountainous with little level land. There 
				are occasional earthquakes.</p>
			</article>
			<article>

				<h3>History</h3>
				<p>During the 17th century, the archipelago was divided into two 
				territorial units, one English and the other Danish. Sugarcane, produced 
				by slave labor, drove the islands' economy during the 18th and early 19th 
				centuries. In 1917, the US purchased the Danish portion, which had been in
				economic decline since the abolition of slavery in 1848.</p>

			<p>When traveling to the <abbr title="United States Virgin Islands">U.S.V.I.</abbr>, 
			U.S. citizens enjoy all the conveniences of domestic travel – including on-line 
			check-in – making travel to the U.S. Virgin Islands easier than ever. As an American territory, travel 
			to the U.S. Virgin Islands does not require a passport for American citizens 
			who are traveling from any part of the United States or its territories, which 
			include Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands, or Swains 
			Islands, as long as a foreign place is not touched during the journey. Entry 
			requirements for non-U.S. citizens are the same as for entering the United 
			States from any foreign destination. Upon departure, a passport is required 
			for all but U.S. citizens [1]. The territory is a "free port" in a separate 
			customs zone from the mainland United States; this means that everyone going 
			to the mainland must go through customs, even though there are no customs when 
			arriving from the mainland. A passport is recommended to make returning easier, 
			and you'll have to plan your purchases accordingly and leave a little extra 
			time to make your departing flight.</p>

				<h3>By Plane</h3>
				<p>Flights are into either St. Croix or St. Thomas. St. John does not have 
				an airport, but is easily accessible via St. Thomas.  Many flights connect 
				through San Juan, Puerto Rico, but direct flights from the continental U.S. 
				involve less hassle and flying time.  Direct flights into St. Thomas can 
				be found from Chicago-O'Hare, Washington-Dulles, and Newark on United 
				Airlines; Miami, Boston, and New York-JFK on American Airlines; Atlanta 
				and Detroit on Delta Airlines; Charlotte, Philadelphia, and New York-La 
				Guardia (weekly) on US Airways, and Ft. Lauderdale on Spirit Airlines.
				Direct flights into St. Croix can be found from Miami on American Airlines; 
				Atlanta (twice weekly) on Delta Air Lines; and Charlotte on US Airways 
				(weekly, seasonal). St. Croix can also be easily reached from St. Thomas 
				by flying Cape Air or also by Seaborne Airlines (which flies seaplanes 
				between Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas and Christiansted, St. Croix).</p>

				<h3>By Boat</h3>
				<p>Ferries run between all three US Virgin Islands, as well as to and from 
				the British Virgin Islands and, on a seasonal basis, Puerto Rico.</p>

			<h2 id="get-around">Get Around</h2>
			<p>Getting around any of the Virgin Islands is fairly easy. All of the islands 
			have bus service and/or a regulated taxi service. Upon docking at Cruz Bay, 
			taxis, rental cars, and scooters are available.</p>
			<article>
				<h3>By Car</h3>
				<p>With plenty to explore on all the islands, car rental agencies are 
				recommended. From the lush rainforest to the quaint Christiansted, driving 
				the St Croix island is both scenic and a visual pleasure. Stick to the 
				left-hand side and with a good handful of sharp curves, take your time 
				navigating the roads. Remember that you're on <q>island time.</q>  Generally 
				car rental rates will be comparable to the mainland U.S. (about $500 per 
				week or $80 per day). If you make advanced reservations, the rates are 
				generally lower. Take out the insurance if you plan to go four wheeling up 
				the steep mountain roads. Throughout St. Thomas, there are colored 
				directional signs to major destinations.  Unlike other U.S. territories, 
				traffic on the Virgin Islands moves on the left. To add to the confusion, 
				unlike most other places where traffic moves on the left, most cars in the 
				Virgin Islands are left-hand drive as they are usually imported from the 
				U.S. mainland. Potholes are large and numerous, similar to the end of a 
				particularly snowy New England winter. Drivers often either slow to around 
				5mph or swing into oncoming traffic when encountering the larger holes. 
				For both reasons, one should always pay extra attention when driving and 
				watch out for drivers who drive on the wrong side of the road. Unmarked 
				one-way streets, very narrow two-ways streets, lack of lane striping, and 
				a high incidence of drunk driving also contribute to the relatively high 
				accident rate among American drivers on the Virgin Islands.  To avoid 
				collisions on hairpin turns in the mountainous areas, stay left and slow 
				to 5mph. Some unpaved mountain roads require four-wheel drive, and some 
				drainage ditches wash across the paved roads in the rain forest. There are 
				generally no sidewalks outside of the towns, so pedestrians and bicycles 
				frequently travel along the side of the main road.  There is a rudimentary 
				highway numbering system. Roads are marked with circular signs. Numbers 
				beginning with 1 and 2 are used on St. John, with 3 and 4 on St. Thomas 
				and 5 to 7 on St. Croix. Roads are not very well marked -- some are not 
				marked at all -- and designations can be confusing. Some roads simply 
				dead-end, or end at an unmarked intersection. Signage can suddenly 
				disappear without warning; for example, heading south on Route 40 into 
				Charlotte Amalie, signage is nowhere to be found as you are shuttled onto 
				one-way streets. It is not uncommon to come to a junction where one must 
				turn to stay on the current road. Locals are more likely to know the names 
				of the roads; conversly, tourist maps usually emphasise the numbers.</p>

				<h3>By Taxi and Bus</h3>
				<p>Upon landing at the Cyril E. King Airport on St. Thomas, one could rent 
				a taxi or take buses to Charlotte Amalie, or to Red Hook, either of which 
				have ferry service to Cruz Bay, St. John. You can "bargain" for most 
				things on the islands, but the taxi and bus rates are regulated. Taxi 
				rates are published by the Virgin Islands Taxicab Commission. If you are 
				interested in saving $8, you can walk 3/4 of a mile to Vetern's Drive and 
				catch a safari bus that will take you into town for $1 or $2 dollars if 
				you have minimal luggage.  Taxi rates are charged per person one way. For 
				example, a one way trip from Charlotte Amalie to Magens Bay is $10; round 
				trip for four people will cost $80. If you plan on visiting multiple 
				destinations, renting a car might be more economical.you need to have bus 
				fares too!</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h3>By Boat</h3>
				<p>Sailboat rentals at Red Hook will allow you to get around by water. If 
				you plan to sail to the British Virgin Islands, a passport is required as 
				of 2007. Although passports are not required for American citizens to 
				travel to the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism 
				Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA) has made the documentation requirements 
				much stricter.  On St. John, get the best idea of the island by chartering 
				a boat for a full day. By doing this not only will one get a wonderful day 
				of snorkeling in, but also see the island from a local's perspective. Try 
				St John Yacht Charters at 340-998-9898.  There is a ferry boat that 
				transports cars between Red Hook, St. Thomas and Cruz Bay, St. John. The 
				dock is separate from the passenger ferries. The sign is really small, so 
				if you can't find the dock, ask the workers by the passenger ferries. The 
				road trip on the car ferry varried from $40-$50 depending on the ferry 
				company and the day. The trip takes about 30 minutes.  Lastly, for a 
				one-stop resource that lists charter companies operating in the U.S. 
				Virgin Islands, consider visiting the Virgin Island Charter Yacht League's 
				site at http://www.vicl.org. The site lists pictures as well as contact 
				information for charters ranging from monohull to power yacht.</p>

			<h2 id="eat">Eat</h2>
			<p>St. Croix is home to a celebrated week-long culinary festival held each 
			April called the St. Croix Food & Wine Experience which includes wine seminars, 
			dinners with celebrity chefs (Kevin Rathbun, Rocco DiSpirito, Robbin Haas, 
			Gerry Klaskala, Richard Reddington are just a few who joined the fun)and the 
			main event, A Taste of St. Croix, showcases foods from more than 50 of the 
			islands restaurants.For a listing of restaurants on the island see 
			www.GoToStCroix.com. Great local food can be found at Harvey's(stew goat), 
			Singh's (roti) and Norma at the Domino Club in the rain forest always has 
			something cooking.  For fine dining, try Tutto Bene, Bacchus, Savant and The 
			Galleon. Rumrunners, located on the waterfront at Hotel Caravelle is perfect 
			for casual, fun dining. They do a great blend of local and traditional 
			American dishes and flavors.  If you want to catch what you eat, go fishing 
			with Carl Holley. His boat, Mokojumbie, ties up on the docks near Rumrunners. 
			He, in fact, supplies many restaurants with fresh fish daily.</p>

			<h2 id="drink">Drink</h2>
			<p>On Saint John dollar drinks are available across the street from the 
			National park office, next to the ice cream shop.  On St. Thomas, There are 
			several drinking establishments in Red Hook, on the East End, including: 
			Caribbean Saloon, Duffy's Love Shack, Fat Boy's, Molly Malone's, Island Time 
			Pizza, and XO Bistro.  On St. Croix, Cruzan Rum is made at a distillery that 
			you can tour. Be sure to do the tour and participate in the tasting after! 
			Cruzan Rum is available just about everywhere, but there are certain flavors 
			(ie Clipper) that are not sold in the USA, so take a bottle back with you. In 
			the seaside town of Christiansted is the Brew Pub which makes several good 
			beers. And, when at local places or events, always ask if there is a local 
			drink. Be wary of the home recipes (ie Mama Wanna) - they are STRONG! Unlike 
			the US Mainland, the drinking age in the Virgin Islands is 18.</p>

			<h2 id="stay-safe">Stay Safe</h2>
			<p>This is the only US territory where driving on the left side (British) of 
			the road is still practiced. There are many theories as to why this is. One 
			theory is due to the prior use of the donkey as a main mode of transportation. 
			Islanders would drive on the left to see how close they were getting to the 
			edge of the many steep and cliff-like roadways. The original donkey trails 
			were then paved over to create what are now the roadways today. Another theory 
			is that as a Danish colony, the Danish West Indies were heavily 
			British-influenced, due to an unwillingness among Danish people to relocate to 
			the Danish colony. This British influence explains the widespread use of the 
			English language even before the United States purchased the islands from 
			Denmark in 1917.  Despite the left-side traffic, cars on the island are 
			generally imported from the mainland U.S. and are left-hand drive. For drivers 
			used to right-side traffic, the switch is pretty easy to make, though you will 
			need to put more conscious thought into turns than normal. In general, other 
			traffic provides an immediate reminder which side to choose; it's easier to 
			forget if you're the only car on the road, but there are fewer cars to crash 
			into in that case. The terror of flying past on the wrong side of traffic will 
			pass after the first few cars, and the readjustment back home to right-hand 
			driving will be a pleasant reminder of your trip. In short, don't be afraid of 
			renting a car no matter which side of the road you normally drive on.  Some 
			parts of St.Thomas, especially Charlotte Amalie can be risky at night. Drug 
			and other related crime is a problem. Tourists should exercise caution when 
			getting around as some neighborhoods can be dangerous, even if a well-known 
			restaurant is in this neighborhood. It is advised to take a taxi.  St. John is 
			a relatively safe island and usual caution is advised when leaving your car 
			unattended, especially at secluded beaches such as Salt Pond Bay. Your car is 
			not a safe and yes, thieves WILL look under the front seat for your wallet.</p>
