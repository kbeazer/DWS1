		<p>Pond plants such as elodea and cabomba can be left in the water, while 
		human-consumed vegetables such as romaine lettuce, escarole and collard greens
		must be changed daily. As sliders are omnivores, insects and freshly killed 
		fish may also be provided for protein. Commercially processed animal-based 
		reptile food may be given too, but any leftovers should be immediately 
		removed to prevent fouling the water.</p>
