		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Adult male yellow-bellied sliders typically reach 5–9 inches in length; 
		females range from 8–13 inches. The carapace (upper shell) is typically brown 
		and black, often with yellow stripes. The skin is olive green with prominent 
		patches of yellow down the neck and legs. As the name implies, the plastron 
		(bottom shell) is mostly yellow with black spots along the edges. Adult males 
		tend to grow darker as they age.  Yellow-bellied sliders are often confused 
		with Eastern River Cooters, who also have yellow stripes on the neck and 
		yellow undersides, but the latter lack the green spots characteristic of 
		T. scripta scripta. The yellow belly often has an "s"-shaped yellow stripe 
		on its face.</p>
