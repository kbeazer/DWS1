		<h1>The CSS Zen Garden</h1>
			<p>The CSS Zen Garden is a website that displays CSS-based designs. Here is list of three designs that I've found to be particularly interesting.</p>
			
		<h2><a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=/216/216.css">Fountain Kiss</a></h2>
			<p><i>Fountain Kiss immediately grabbed my attention.  Here are some attributes that made me place this design at the top of my list:</i></p>
				<ul>
					<li>the font is quite easy to read and absorb</li>
					<li>the colors are warm and easy on the eyes</li>
					<li>the background image is subtle, and without distractions</li>
					<li>the margins were created using opaque colors</li>
				</ul>
		
		<h2><a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=/215/215.css">A Robot Named Jimmy</a></h2>
			<p><i>A Robot Named Jimmy is also quite interesting.  This design shows you that you really don't need to fill every corner of your page in order to make the design look presentable.  Here are some of the things that I found to be lovely about this site:</i></p>
				<ul>
					<li>the font looks very clean and structured</li>
					<li>the colors are very bright, and the text almost jumps out at you</li>
					<li>slight motion in the background gives the page life</li>
					<li>the opaque layout gives you the ability to view the background without distracting you from the main page content</li>
				</ul>
		<h2><a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/?cssfile=/214/214.css">Verde Moderna</a></h2>
			<p><i>The Verde Moderna is by far the most professional designs on this site in my opinion.  Some of the elements that really caught my attention are listed as followed:</i></p>					
				<ul>
					<li>the fon't gives the design a very sleek look</li>
					<li>the colors used are very rich and earthy</li>
					<li>the background makes the design look like a painting</li>
					<li>the page is very easy to navigate around</li>
				</ul>
