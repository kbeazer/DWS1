			<p class="description">The yellow-bellied slider is a land and water turtle 
			belonging to the family <em>Emydidae.</em> This subspecies of pond slider is native to 
			the southeastern United States, specifically from Florida to southeastern 
			Virginia, and is the most common turtle species in its range. It is found in a
			wide variety of habitats, including slow-moving rivers, floodplain swamps, 
			marshes, seasonal wetlands, and permanent ponds. Yellow-bellied sliders are 
			also very popular as pets.</p>

			<p class="housing">Baby yellow-bellied sliders may be kept in a fairly small 
			tank, but as they age, after about three years, they will require much more 
			space. One or two  adults may be housed in a 75 US gal aquarium. The turtles 
			require enough water to turn around, with a depth of 16–18 inches recommended.
			Water temperature should be kept between 72–80°F (22–27°C) and properly 
			filtered. Keeping fish with turtles is usually avoided due to the risky nature
			of a turtle to eat the fish. Sliders need a basking area that is kept warm 
			during the day and that will allow the turtle to move around, balance, and dry
			off completely. This area should average 89–95°F (32–35°C) and can be heated 
			with a UV-A heat lamp. A second lamp that produces UV-B is absolutely 
			essential for the turtle to metabolize calcium properly. Direct, unfiltered 
			sunlight is preferable. The lamps should be switched on during 
			daylight hours. Turtle tanks can be purchased at many pet goods retailers. 
			<strong>For no reason should yellow bellied slider turtles be put in an aquarium 
			with other turtles, due to the risk of injury resulting from territorial 
			dispute.</strong></p>

			<p class="diet">Pond plants such as elodea and cabomba can be left in the 
			water, while human-consumed vegetables such as romaine lettuce, escarole and 
			collard greens must be changed daily. As sliders are omnivores, insects and 
			freshly killed fish may also be provided for protein. Commercially processed 
			animal-based reptile food may be given too, but any leftovers should be 
			immediately removed to prevent fouling the water.</p>
