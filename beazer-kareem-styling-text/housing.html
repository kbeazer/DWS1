		<h2>Housing</h2>
		<p>Baby yellow-bellied sliders may be kept in a fairly small tank, but as they
		 age, after about three years, they will require much more space. One or two 
		 adults may be housed in a 75 US gal aquarium. The turtles require enough 
		 water to turn around, with a depth of 16–18 inches recommended. Water 
		 temperature should be kept between 72–80°F (22–27°C) and properly filtered. 
		 Keeping fish with turtles is usually avoided due to the risky nature of a 
		 turtle to eat the fish. Sliders need a basking area that is kept warm during
		 the day and that will allow the turtle to move around, balance, and dry off 
		 completely. This area should average 89–95°F (32–35°C) and can be heated 
		 with a UV-A heat lamp. A second lamp that produces UV-B is absolutely 
		 essential for the turtle to metabolize calcium properly. Direct, 
		 unfiltered sunlight is preferable. The lamps should be switched on during 
		 daylight hours. Turtle tanks can be purchased at many pet goods retailers. 
		 For no reason should yellow bellied slider turtles be put in an aquarium 
		 with other turtles, due to the risk of injury resulting from territorial 
		 dispute.</p>
